### Heya! I'm Rijk van Zanten, lead maintainer of [Directus](https://directus.io) 👋

I build things, design stuff, and like to keep my sources open. I primarily focus on building and maintaining Directus, but don't shy away from some fun projects on the side 🌝

I'm best reached on email: 
- Directus: rijk@directus.io
- Personal: rijkvanzanten@me.com

or Bluesky: [@rijk.nyc](https://bsky.app/profile/rijk.nyc)

Always happy to chat! (Please no cold sales outreach however, I will not respond 🙏)
